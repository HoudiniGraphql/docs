# ⚠️&nbsp;&nbsp;Notes, Constraints, and Conventions

- The compiler must be run every time the contents of a `graphql` tagged string changes
- Every GraphQL Document must have a name that is unique
- Variable functions must be named after their query
- Documents with a query must have only one operation in them
- Documents without an operation must have only one fragment in them
