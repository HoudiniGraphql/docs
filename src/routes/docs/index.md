# Houdini

The disappearing GraphQL client for Sapper and SvelteKit.

- Composable and colocated data requirements for your components
- Normalized cache with declarative updates
- Generated types
- Subscriptions
- Support for SvelteKit and Sapper
- Pagination (cursors and offsets)

At its core, houdini seeks to enable a high quality developer experience without compromising bundle size. Like Svelte, houdini shifts what is traditionally handled by a bloated runtime into a compile step that allows for the generation of an incredibly lean GraphQL abstraction for your application.

## Example

A demo can be found in the [example directory](https://github.com/AlecAivazis/houdini/tree/main/example).

Please note that the examples in that directory and this readme showcase the typescript definitions generated by the compiler. While it is highly recommended, Typescript is NOT required in order to use houdini.
