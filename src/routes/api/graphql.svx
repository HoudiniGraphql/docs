# GraphQL API

Houdini adds a number of runtime definitions to your GraphQL schema in order to support its declarative API.

## Fragments

### List Operations

A field marked with `@list` or by passing a name to `@paginate` can use the following fragments in mutations or subscriptions to update the list:

- `[ListName]_insert`: insert the reference into the list
- `[ListName]_remove`: remove the reference from the list
- `[ListName]_toggle`: if the reference is already in the list, remove it; otherwise, add it to the list

Some things worth mentioning:

- Insert locations for for the `insert` and `toggle` fragments can be specified using the `prepend` or `append` directives specified below
- Conditions for the operations can be specified with `@when` or `@when_not` shown below.
- These fragments can be applied to lists and single values.
- Sometimes the runtime needs a little help to hunt down the list you want to mutate. For more information on how to use `@parentID` to help, [see below](#parentidvalue-string).

For more information on using these fragments, head over to the [mutation docs](/api/mutation#lists).

## Directives

### `@list(name: String!)`

`@list` marks a field as the target for list operations. Must be passed a name which defines the fragments that can be used to mutate the list. See the [list operations](#list-operations) for more information.

### `@prepend(parentID: ID)`

`@prepend` is used in conjunction with the [list operation fragments](#list-operations) to tell the runtime to add the element at the start of the list. Can be used with both `_insert` and `_toggle` fragments. If the list is a member of a fragment, you will have to pass a value for the `parentID` so the correct list can be updated, otherwise the argument should be omitted.

### `@append(parentID: ID)`

`@append` is used in conjunction with the [list operation fragments](#list-operations) to tell the runtime to add the element at the end of the list. Can be used with both `_insert` and `_toggle` fragments. If the list is a member of a fragment, you will have to pass a value for the `parentID` so the correct list can be updated, otherwise the argument should be omitted.

### `@when`

`@when` provides a conditional under which the [list operation](#list-operations) should be executed. It takes arguments that match the arguments of the field tagged with `@list` or `@paginate`. For more information, check out the [mutation docs](/api/mutation#lists).

```graphql
mutation UncompleteItem($id: ID!) {
	uncheckItem(item: $id) {
		item {
			# only remove the item from the list of filtered items
			# if we are only showing the completed ones
			...All_Items_remove @when(completed: true)
		}
	}
}
```

### `@when_not`

`@when` provides a conditional under which the [list operation](#list-operations) should not be executed. It takes arguments that match the arguments of the field tagged with `@list` or `@paginate`. For more information, check out the [mutation docs](/api/mutation#lists)

```graphql
mutation NewItem($input: AddItemInput!) {
	addItem(input: $input) {
		# only add the item to the list if we can see uncompleted items
		...All_Items_insert @when_not(completed: true)
	}
}
```

### `@cache(policy: CachePolicy, partial: Boolean)`

`@cache` is used on a query document to customize the cache behavior. This includes informaton like what [cache policy](/api/query#caching-data) should be used by the runtime or if you are okay with partial results from the cache. For a full list of cache policies, check out the [query docs](/api/query#caching-data) and for more information on partial responses, see the [partial data guide](/guies/partial-data).

### `@paginate(name: String)`

A field marked with `@paginate` is updated with calls to the page loaders returned by the pagination function. For more information on pagination check out the [guide](/guides/pagination). If you pass a value for the `name` argument, the underlying list can be updated using the [operation fragments](/api/mutations#lists).

### `@[TypeName]_delete`

`@[TypeName]_delete` (ie, something like `@User_delete`) is used to delete the user with an id found in the body of a subscription or mutation. Like the operation fragments, this directive can be applied to lists or singular values. For more information see the [mutation docs](/api/mutation#lists).

```graphql
mutation DeleteItem($input: DeleteItemInput!) {
	deleteItem(input: $input) {
		# this will delete the item with the matching id from the cache
		# and remove it from all lists
		deletedID @Item_delete
	}
}
```

### `@parentID(value: String!)`

`@parentID` is used to identify the root ID for the document containing a list marked with `@list` or `@paginate` when it cannot be inferred. For example, imagine a situation where there are multiple users rendered on a view that shows their top 5 bands. That listing is represented with a fragment containing `@list(name: "FavoriteBands")`. If we wanted add a band to just our own list, we need to specify that we want to add something to the list that starts from a fragment on a User with the correct ID:

```graphql
mutation FavoriteBand($input: FavoriteBandInput!) {
	setFavorite(input: $input) {
		# only add the item to the list if we can see uncompleted items
		...All_Items_insert @parentID(value: "abcdef")
	}
}
```
